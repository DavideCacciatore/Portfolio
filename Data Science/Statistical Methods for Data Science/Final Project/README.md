## Bayesian hierarchical models for the prediction of football results

Statistical modelling of sports data is a popular topic and much research has been produced for this purpose,
also with reference to football.

For this project, I considered the work done by Baio & Blangiardo (2010) to model football results during
a Serie A season. I attempted to apply their first model, assuming two conditionally independent Poisson
variables for the number of goals scored. Next, I will attempt to compare its performance with a Negative
Binomial model proposed in past work (Pollard et al. 1977) and with a frequentist approach. I applied
these models to the 2021-2022 Italian Serie A data.
