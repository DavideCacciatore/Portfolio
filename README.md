## **Hi! I am Davide Cacciatore!**

I'm a future data scientist and this is my personal portfolio with all the projects and works I have done during my career.

Born in Bari in 1999, I study Data Science and I am passionate about everything related to data. I am interested in sports, technology, movies, gaming and I play Underwater Hockey.

In the **Data Science** folder there are all the projects made during my Master's Degree at La Sapienza, while inside **Scienze Statistiche** there are some projects, including my thesis, made during by Bachelor's Degree at Universit√† di Bari.
